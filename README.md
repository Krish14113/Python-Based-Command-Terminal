# Python Based Command Terminal

## Overview
The **Python Based Command Terminal** is a fully client-side, browser-based terminal that simulates a Linux-like environment.  
It features a **sandboxed virtual filesystem** stored entirely in your browser's `localStorage`, meaning your real computer files are never touched.  
This makes it a perfectly safe environment for **learning and experimenting** with shell commands.

The standout feature is its **AI integration with OpenRouter**.  
If you type a command that the virtual terminal doesn't recognize, it treats your input as a natural language prompt and asks an AI to generate the correct command for you, which is then executed automatically.

## üîë API Key Setup (Required for AI Features)
To enable the natural language-to-command feature, you must provide your own **OpenRouter API key**.

1. **Get a Key**  
   Go to [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai), sign up for a free account, and navigate to the **Keys** section in your account settings to create a new API key.

2. **Enter the Key**  
   Copy your new API key.  
   In the AI Virtual Terminal, paste this key into the **‚ÄúOpenRouter API Key‚Äù** input box located in the top controls bar.

3. **Save the Key**  
   Click the **Save Key** button.  
   Your key will be securely saved in your browser‚Äôs local storage.  
   It is only used to communicate with the OpenRouter API and will be remembered automatically for future sessions.
